# office-desks

Hello Fellow Githubbers,

I like Node.js and was recently introduced to JAMStack. I'm excited to learn more about Netlify and JAMStack to see how easy they could make a Developer's life.
Oh and BTW, this project is my attempt at creating a static site where I have my friends and colleagues upload pictures of their home office desks from 2020.
